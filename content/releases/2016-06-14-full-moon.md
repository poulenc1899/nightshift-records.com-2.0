Having built a reputation for matching pop sensibility with a shirt­-off dancefloor
hedonism over two acclaimed releases on International Feel, [Private Agenda](https://private-agenda.com) return with _Full Moon_ - the first release on their own imprint, Nightshift which channels those iconic vocal-led disco 12’’s of old.

Cazzo Pazzo ­(that’s Andy Butler of Hercules & Love Affair fame & long-time collaborator Joie Iacono) steer the original into the depths of the 80s fledgling disco underground (Brooklyn by way of Bologna) before Life on Planets offer up a masterful dubbed-out out groove. Completing the package, Ichisan -  not content with offering us just one stellar remix -  produces a disco double­-whammy; opting first for stellar slice of Scandinavian-inspired nudisco, before closing with something for the Balearic-inclined with a majestic samba dub.
