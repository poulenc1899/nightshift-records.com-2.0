How would you feel if I wrote a song about you? [Private Agenda’s](https://private-agenda.com) latest EP, _Affection_ is a soundtrack to those crash-and-burn romances. The backing track to your next hookup, the hold music to the next fuck-up. A synth-pop deluge of sweat and regret. A thematic and musical fusion of romantic pop songwriting and whirlwind dating culture. Four tracks which unite disparate underground influences, contemporary production and classic pop songwriting. A poke at pop’s mainstream with firm roots in the queer musical underground.

Opener _Instinct_ sets the scene, a blockships-thrusting slice of seductive synth-pop, real carnal and immediate.  _Ballad of a Bad Boy_ then checks the lovers’ pursuit, oozing melancholy. Change delights in referential classic pop with its romantic intimacy and wistful balladry, before closer _Bedsheets_ whips off the old rags for a cathartic climatic cleanse, brimming with positivity and poise.
